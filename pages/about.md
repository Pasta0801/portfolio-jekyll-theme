Guten Tag, my name is Pawel and I'm currently working at CeramTec GmbH in Plochingen near Stuttgart. I studied engineering management in Karlsruhe (Bachelor) and in Berlin (Master). In our B2B manufacturing company i'm working as a digitalization consultant. I'm currently working on projects like process automation or extraction of technical features out of drawings. My next goal is to lead a project in Data Analytics (such as predictive maintenance in operations or other) helping my company to become more data-driven and builing models to lower cost and boost efficiency.
